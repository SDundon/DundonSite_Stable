abstract = "Animal, fungal, and amoeboid cells assemble an actomyosin ring from conserved proteins that constricts the cleavage furrow during cytokinesis at the end of the cell cycle. Many studies have examined the physical forces during contractile ring constriction, but less is known about how cells ensure proper timing of ring assembly and constriction. Experiments on the fission yeast *Schizosaccharomyces pombe* have suggested that a checkpoint regulates constriction, but the molecular components and mechanisms of this checkpoint are unclear. <br><br> We hypothesize that this checkpoint includes a molecular “brake” to inhibit actomyosin ring constriction until all checkpoint requirements are satisfied. In *S. pombe*, complete assembly of the actomyosin ring as well as recruitment of cell wall synthesis enzymes is necessary to initiate constriction. *S. pombe* cells with the temperature-sensitive *bgs1-191* mutation (the gene encoding one of the ß-glucan synthases that synthesizes the primary septum) activate the constriction checkpoint and build rings that do not constrict at 36°C. Therefore, the brake is engaged in these cells. Using this background to activate the checkpoint reliably, we have evidence that the famous cell cycle kinase Wee1 (which inhibits CDK activity to regulate mitotic entry) has a role in this poorly understood checkpoint. In contrast with *bgs1-191* alone, *bgs1-191 wee1-50* double mutants successfully complete cytokinesis at 36°C. Therefore, loss of Wee1 function compromises the brake. Accordingly, Wee1 overexpression prolongs ring assembly, delays the onset of ring constriction, and slows ring constriction. These data support our hypothesis that a brake inhibits ring constriction in response to checkpoint activation, and indicate that Wee1 is a component of this brake. Additionally, ring disassembly is defective in *wee1-50* cells at 36°C. These data are consistent with a model in which Wee1 inhibits myosin activity in the contractile ring, and reveal a novel role for this well-studied kinase in regulating the final steps of the cell cycle."

I am investigating mechanisms of cytokinetic regulation the fission yeast *Schizosaccharomyces pombe*. The final step of cell division is the physical separation of daughter cells by cytokinesis. This process is crucial for growth of all organisms. The cell cycle and cytokinesis must but must be properly regulated to enable growth and development as well as to prevent division errors. Cytokinetic failure leads to aberrant ploidy increases, which contribute to tumorigenesis. Decades of research have been spent elucidating the mechanisms governing this essential process; however, many aspects of its regulation remain poorly understood.

Previous work suggests the existence of a checkpoint regulating the initiation of actomyosin ring constriction during cytokinesis in *S. pombe*. I am using genetic, microscopy, and biochemical approaches to identify the components of this checkpoint and determine the molecular mechanisms of their regulation of cytokinesis.

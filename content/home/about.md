# About Me

I am a postdoctoral researcher studying cytokinetic regulation in the lab of

at
<a href="https://www.yale.edu/" target="_blank">Yale University</a>. I earned my PhD studying cell cycle regulation in a multinucleate fungus with

I am fascinated by how the essential operations and functions of cells function in healthy organisms and how their alteration can cause disease. Throughout my graduate and postdoctoral work, I have studied multiple aspects of cell cycle regulation using genetics, quantitative microscopy, and biochemistry. Currently, I use fission yeast as a model eukaryote to understand regulation of cytokinesis timing.

I envision a long-term research program focused on understanding how cells regulate essential processes including nuclear division, partitioning of cellular components, and cellular division. I want to use these insights to shed light on how these are manipulated to drive cancer progression and how to target these processes for novel therapies. In my independent lab, I will continue to combine a multitude of techniques to further our understanding of cellular growth and function. I plan to leverage the advantages of different model eukaryotes to elucidate fundamental processes and apply these results to focus research on homologous systems in mammalian cells.

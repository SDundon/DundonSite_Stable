# About Me

I am a postdoctoral researcher studying cytokinetic regulation in the lab of
<a href="https://pollardlab.yale.edu/" target="_blank">Dr. Thomas Pollard</a>
at
<a href="https://www.yale.edu/" target="_blank">Yale University</a>. I earned my PhD studying cell cycle regulation in a multinucleate fungus with
<a href="http://gladfelterlab.web.unc.edu/" target="_blank">Dr. Amy Gladfelter</a>
at
<a href="https://home.dartmouth.edu/" target="_blank">Dartmouth</a>.

I am passionate about conducting and communicating science, as well as training others and being part of a multidisciplinary research team. I am fascinated by how the essential operations and functions of cells function in healthy organisms and how their alteration can cause disease. Throughout my graduate and postdoctoral work, I have studied multiple aspects of cell cycle regulation using genetics, quantitative microscopy, and biochemistry. Currently, I use fission yeast as a model eukaryote to understand regulation of cytokinesis timing. This work has broad implications for normal human development and cancer, in which cell division goes awry.

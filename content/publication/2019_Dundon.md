abstract = "Microtubules of the mitotic spindle direct cytokinesis in metazoans but this has not been documented in fungi. We report evidence that astral microtubules help coordinate cytokinetic furrow formation in fission yeast. The temperature-sensitive cps1-191 strain (Liu et al., 1999) with a D277N substitution in β-glucan synthase 1 (Cps1/Bgs1) was reported to arrest with an unconstricted contractile ring. We discovered that rings in cps1-191 cells do constrict slowly and that an S338N mutation in the mto2 gene is required with the bgs1D277N mutation to reproduce the cps1-191 phenotype. Complexes of Mto2 and Mto1 with γ-tubulin regulate microtubule assembly. Deletion of Mto1 along with the bgs1D277N mutation also gives the cps1-191 phenotype, which is not observed in mto2S338N or mto1Δ cells expressing bgs1+. Both mto2S338N and mto1Δ cells nucleate fewer astral microtubules than normal and have higher levels of Rho1-GTP at the division site than wild-type cells. We report multiple conditions that sensitize mto1Δ and mto2S338N cells to furrow ingression phenotypes."

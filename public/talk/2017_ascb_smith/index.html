      <p class="pub-abstract" itemprop="text">Syncytia, cells containing multiple nuclei, are found throughout the biosphere. These cells are essential for mammalian muscle and placenta development, and area  common state of fungal pathogens. Interestingly, nuclei in fungal, muscle, and placental syncytia have different transcriptional programs despite sharing the same cytoplasmic environment. This independent nuclear behavior suggests that the cytosol is compartmentalized thereby insulating neighboring nuclei. We have found that mRNAs are non-randomly positioned near nuclei in fungal syncytia via incorporation into granule-like RNA/protein (RNP) structures. These structures are droplet-like and the core components can undergo liquid-liquid phase separation. In this system, liquid droplets act to spatially regulate mRNAs controlling the cell cycle. We hypothesize that cytosol compartmentalization via RNP droplets is a conserved mechanism for multinucleate cells to spatially organize the cytosol. To test this hypothesis, we are using mouse myotubes in which nuclei have autonomous transcriptional programs in a common cytoplasm and mRNAs appear spatially patterned. Transcripts encoding the acetylcholine receptor (AchR) show non-random subcellular localization, where AchR protein clusters also form, suggesting these transcripts are locally translated. Here, we identified FXR1, or Fragile X-Related protein, as a potential <em>AchR</em> binding protein through a bioinformatics screen. FXR1 is an intrinsically-disordered RNA-binding protein, and is essential for muscle development with knockout mice dying shortly after birth due to respiratory or cardiac failure.
